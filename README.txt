Hi, the files we submitted on MarkUs are only part of our final work, as evidence that we completed our own work.
However, we still have many other files for the data exploration, model choice, model compare, hyperparameter tune and
final model test etc. Please look at the git repo:

https://github.com/FXXFERMI/CSC311_ML.git

It includes everything for our project. It also has a very detail README.md, you can check on if you want to run our
code locally.

p.s. we also have the git repo in our report, at the bottom of first page.
